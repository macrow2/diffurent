# Diffurent

A discord bot made with furries as the target audience.

## Features

Diffurent currently only has 2 main features, but I'm always thinking of things to add, and open to suggestions!

- Private rooms (for roleplay, or for just dicking around with bot commands)
- E621 Browser, with voting and favorites, and tag autocomplete (for the horny people)

## Roadmap

Features I plan to add in the future.

- Moderation commands

## Getting started

So, how do you run the thing?

First, double check you have the following installed:
- Git
- Node JS (latest lts preferred)

Then open your favorite terminal emulator, and type these commands: 

```bash
# clone the thing
git clone https://github.com/macrow2/diffurent/
# now go into the directory
cd diffurent
# install node modules
npm install
# build
npm run build
# and start
npm run start
# or, you can run:
# npm run test
# to build *and* start the thing
```
